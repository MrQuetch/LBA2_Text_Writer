# LBA2: Text Writer
This is a program to write text files for LBA2. Entire text files can be replaced with the same strings or use their own strings.

To extract the text files from the Little Big Adventure 2 (Twinsen's Odyssey) game, use Zink's LBA Package Editor program from the https://www.magicball.net/ website. Here is the exact link: https://www.magicball.net/downloads/programs/development/lba_package_editor.

Open an HQR file (High Quality Resource) - using Zink's program, and right-click on the desired entries to extract them to a location on your computer. To check how many strings are in an island, use George's LBA Text program from the same website: https://www.magicball.net/downloads/programs. The extracted entries can be opened in his program and the strings can also be edited there.

My program is different in the fact that you can make an island text file of your own size and use repeating strings. Some islands in the game use more strings than others. If the number of strings for an island is little or more than what it originally is, the game may crash at unexpected moments.
